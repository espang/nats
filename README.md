# nats

A nats client written in clojure.

## status

I just started to implement a nats client in clojure.

## progress

I am currently working on setting up the initial connection. This should include handling the `INFO` command from the server aswell as implementing `PING` and `PONG`.

## plan

- [ ] Protocol parser
- [ ] Connection handler
- [ ] Publish & Subscribe
- [ ] Make it correct
- [ ] Make it faster
- [ ] Compare to existing libraries
- [ ] Implement a server
